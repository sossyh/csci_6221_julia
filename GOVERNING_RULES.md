# Group Governing Rules – Julia Project

---

## a) Team Member Names
- Joshua Kweon  
- Mohamad Koubeissi  
- Sosna Achamyeleh  

---

## b) Collaboration Style
We will work using a blend of **synchronous** (live meetings) and **asynchronous** (communications via shared tools) collaboration.

- **Synchronous Tools**: Google Meet or Zoom for real-time teamwork.  
- **Asynchronous Tools**: Google Docs for shared documentation, plus WhatsApp/Slack (or another messaging platform) for updates and quick clarifications.  
- **Decision Protocol**: Aim for consensus; if needed, decisions will be made by simple majority vote among members.  
- **Documentation**: All progress, decisions, and changes will be documented clearly in the shared Google Doc.

## c) Weekly Work Schedule

### Synchronous (Live) Meetings
We’ll aim to meet at the following regular times:
- **Tuesday:** 6:00 PM – 7:30 PM (online)  
- **Friday:** 4:00 PM – 5:30 PM (online)  

*(These times anchor our schedule but are flexible if a member needs a small shift.)*  

### Asynchronous Workflow
- **Weekly Updates**: Each member should add their contributions to the shared Google Doc by **Sunday at 8:00 PM**.  
- **Review Deadline**: Everyone should review these updates before the Tuesday session to stay aligned.

## d) Ground Rules
1. **Attendance**: Attend all scheduled synchronous meetings unless you notify the group at least 24 hours in advance.  
2. **Communication**: Respond to group messages within 24 hours, unless otherwise agreed.  
3. **Task Distribution**: Tasks will be divided based on individual strengths and current workload; everyone takes ownership for their part.  
4. **Accountability**: If you anticipate missing a deadline, communicate proactively and feel free to ask for help from teammates.  
5. **Respect and Professionalism**: Maintain an environment of mutual respect. Provide constructive feedback and be open to ideas and suggestions.

## f) Version Control and Code Repository
We will use the Julia GitHub repository as the central code base:  

Repository: [https://github.com/sossyh/csci_6221_julia.git](https://github.com/sossyh/csci_6221_julia.git)  

- Each member will clone this to work on features, then push updates back via branches or merge requests.  
- Follow good practices: commit often, use descriptive messages, and discuss before merging major changes.
